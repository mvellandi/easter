/* Custom styles for the Easter Egg System */
/* The .ee-modal-base class was previously used to set some global modal defaults.
   These are now largely covered by the more specific variables in @theme.
   If .ee-modal-base is applied to a root container of the modal system, 
   it could set some foundational styles or use some of the new system variables.
   The exact usage depends on how it's applied in the Vue components.
   For now, updating it to use new variables as examples.
