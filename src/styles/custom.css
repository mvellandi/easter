/* @layer is a tailwind-only keyword
The names (base, components, utilities) are special Tailwind layer names.
They control the order in which styles are applied:

@layer base { ... } — for resets and base styles (lowest specificity)
@layer components { ... } — for custom component classes (medium specificity)
@layer utilities { ... } — for custom utility classes (highest specificity)

This helps you avoid specificity issues and ensures your custom styles are merged in the right place in the final CSS. Example:

@layer components {
  .my-modal {
    @apply p-4 rounded bg-[var(--color-ee-modal-bg)];
  }
}

This will be merged into Tailwind’s components layer, so it’s applied after base styles but before utilities.
